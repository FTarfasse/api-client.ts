# Getting Started

The TypeScript API Client for Octopus Deploy provides a collection of repositories that target their respective service endpoints available in Octopus Deploy.

Import the following types to your TypeScript source file:

```typescript
import { Client, ClientConfiguration, Repository } from '@octopusdeploy/api-client';
```

These types serve different functions:

* `Client` is used to manage connections with Octopus Deploy and provides events for successful/failed requests
* `ClientConfiguration` describes the configuration parameters needed to establish a connection to Octopus Deploy, including the API key
* `Repository` is the base "entry point" for developers to access the available repositories that represent service endpoints available in Octopus Deploy

Next, define a `ClientConfiguration` to define the parameters to use for connecting to Octopus Deploy:

```typescript
const configuration: ClientConfiguration = {
    agent: new Agent(/* ... */), // proxy agent if required for debugging
    apiKey: 'api-key',
    apiUri: 'api-uri',
    autoConnect: true,
    space: 'space-id',
};
```

Each parameter serve a specific purpose:

* `agent` (optional) defines an HTTP proxy agent that may be defined for debugging purposes (i.e. Fiddler) -- useful for viewing inbound/outbound messages between the API client and the target instance of Octopus Deploy
* `apiKey` (required) defines the API key to be used to connect to Octopus Deploy (see [How to Create an API Key](https://octopus.com/docs/octopus-rest-api/how-to-create-an-api-key) for more information concerning API keys)
* `apiUri` (required) defines the full URI of target instance of Octopus Deploy (i.e. `'https://demo.octopus.app'`)
* `autoConnect` (optional) informs the `Client` to automatically attempt to connect to the target instance of Octopus Deploy when `Client.create()` is invoked
* `space`: (optional) defines the target space in Octopus Deploy for API operations -- assumes the default space if undefined

Once you've defined the client configuration, the next step is to connect to the target instance of Octopus Deploy:

```typescript
let client: Client | undefined;

try {
    client = await Client.create(configuration);
} catch (error) {
    console.error('The TypeScript API client could not be constructed.');
    return;
}

if (client === null || client === undefined) {
    return;
}
```

At this point, a client connection to the target instance of Octopus Deploy has been established and the repository is set to be initialized. This step is accomplished as follows:

```typescript
const repository = new Repository(client);
```

The repository will retrieve and process the root document (`/api`) of the Octopus API (i.e. `HTTP GET https://demo.octopus.app/api`). This document provides key/value mappings of the endpoints available by the target instance of Octopus Deploy. Once this document is processed by the `repository`, API calls may be invoked.

Here is an example of conducting a search against the `projects` endpoint to find a project in Octopus Deploy by its ID (i.e. `Projects-123`) or by its name (i.e. `Deployment Project`):

```typescript
const projectNameOrId: string = 'project-name-or-ID';

console.log(`Getting project, "${projectNameOrId}"...`);

let project: ProjectResource | undefined;

try {
  project = await repository.projects.find(projectNameOrId);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}

if (project !== null && project !== undefined) {
  console.log(`Project found: "${project?.Name}" (${project?.Id})`);
} else {
  console.error(`Project, "${projectNameOrId}" not found`);
}
```

There are various endpoints to use that are exposed through the `repository` -- each of these provide access to the operations that are exposed through Octopus Deploy.

Happy deployments! üêô
